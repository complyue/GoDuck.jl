# Julia Goes Duck typing

Here's **GoDuck.jl**

> Instead of *Multiple Dispatch* based typing, now you have an option to develop **Julia** programs in a similar language but fullier dynamically typed (i.e. *Duck Typing*) as well as with *Object* style *dot-notation*s. I.e. to use the intuition you namespacing **Python** methods.

> Yet neither *macro*s, nor *Generic Type*s anymore, here you are *Object Class Hierarchies* with *Multiple Inheritance* (*S3 linearized*), and novel *Dynamic Scoped Effect*s.

> Scripting is the primary goal of `.gdj` codebases, (raw machine) performance is not. **Julia** under-the-hood will give you performance as awlays and in all its ingenious ways.
