# Julia Goes Duck typing

Here's **GoDuck.jl**

> Instead of *Multiple Dispatch* based typing, now you have an option to develop **Julia** programs in a similar language but fullier dynamically typed (i.e. *Duck Typing*).

> Yet no *Generic Type*s anymore, here you are *Object Oriented* *Multiple Inheritance* (*S3 linearized*), as well as *Dynamic Scoped Effect*s.
